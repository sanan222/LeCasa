# LeCasa
LeCasa is a Real2Sim2Real platform for joint-level teleoperation, dataset collection, VLA policy training, and evaluation in both simulation and real robots. This work focuses on single- and multi-stage tasks in RoboCasa kitchens using the SO101 arm, with policies trained through the LeRobot scheme.
